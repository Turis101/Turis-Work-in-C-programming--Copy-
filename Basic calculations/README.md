1. Question Number: 
    Problem 4: BASIC CALCULATIONS

2. Description (What the question wants you to achieve)
    The question wants me to write up programs in C to work with variables to calculate formulas as stated.

3. Installation Steps (How did you set up the project & added VC)
    - I installed Codeblocks
    - setup a working folder to store my C program files
    - wrote the programs in Codebloocks and saved them in that folder as created.
    - initialized git in that folder using command prompt.
    - This created a git repository which I can easily push to a remote repository
    - I then commited the changes and added branches, later merging them and pushing to the remote repository on github.

4. Usage (Give examples of how you can use the program)
    I use the program to calculate formulas depending on the desired user inputs.

5. Features of program (What makes up the program)
    - The program is a basic rundown of variables and print functions.

6. Contributing (Add any guidelines for contributing to the program)
    - For contributions, you can clone the repository from my github @Turis101
    - Then work on the program and declare pull requests which I can crosscheck and approve before merging to the main branch.
    - You can as well fork the repo I think.
